    I was born in Montego Bay, Jamaica but have grown up in Chicago, Illinois since the age of 5 when my family moved to the United States. I have always had a great interest in science and received my bachelors degree in Ecology, Ethology, and
    Evolution from the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana. After this I worked in cancer research before returning to the University of Illinois C-U to complete my Masters of Education in Curriculum and Instruction and obtain my teaching
    certificate.<br><br>

    I have worked in the capacity of science teacher for the Chicago public school system as well as science instructional specialist for over 20 secondary schools within CPS. During that time I was able to work with hundreds of teachers throughout
    the city offering professional development, coaching, and working closely with many principals and teachers to help improve the science instruction offered at their schools My first love still continued to be classroom instruction so I decided to
    broaden my experience by moving into teaching internationally.<br><br>

    The Codrington School in Barbados was my first foray into this arena and I was richly rewarded throughout my 3 years there, where I have worked as IB MYP/Diploma science teacher for grades 6-11 and IB Middle Years Program Curriculum Coordinator.
    For the first 2 years I was the only science teacher for this small but growing school. I literally taught all science classes from 6th through 10th grade until we hired another teacher to cover some classes as the students moved into the IB
    Diploma program. During my time there I taught Integrated Science, IB Diploma Biology, and even technology classes. After Barbados I moved to South America, taking a job at the Uruguayan American School in Montevideo, Uruguay. Over the course of
    2 years I taught Life Science, General Science, Physical Science, General and AP Biology. It was a very interesting experience working with students that mostly spoke English as a second or even third language. My last overseas foray was in
    Panama City, Panama at The International School of Panama, which was a much larger school. I taught General Biology, General Physics, and IB Diploma Environmental Systems and Societies, once again to mostly ELL students.
