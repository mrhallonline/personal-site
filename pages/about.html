  <h1>About me</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <p>I was born in Montego Bay, Jamaica but have grown up in Chicago, Illinois since the age of 5 when my family moved
      to the United States. I have always had a great interest in science and received my bachelors degree in Ecology,
      Ethology, and Evolution from the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana. After this I worked in cancer research
      before returning to the University of Illinois C-U to complete my Masters of Education in Curriculum and
      Instruction and obtain my teaching certificate.
    </p>
    <p>I have worked in the capacity of science teacher for the Chicago public school system as well as science
      instructional specialist for over 20 secondary schools within CPS. During that time I was able to work with
      hundreds of teachers throughout the city offering professional development, coaching, and working closely with
      many principals and teachers to help improve the science instruction offered at their schools My first love still
      continued to be classroom instruction so I decided to broaden my experience by moving into teaching
      internationally.</p>
    <p>The Codrington School in Barbados was my first foray into this arena and I was richly rewarded throughout my 3
      years there, where I have worked as IB MYP/Diploma science teacher for grades 6-11 and IB Middle Years Program
      Curriculum Coordinator. For the first 2 years I was the only science teacher for this small but growing school. I
      literally taught all science classes from 6th through 10th grade until we hired another teacher to cover some
      classes as the students moved into the IB Diploma program. During my time there I taught Integrated Science, IB
      Diploma Biology, and even technology classes. After Barbados I moved to South America, taking a job at the
      Uruguayan American School in Montevideo, Uruguay. Over the course of 2 years I taught Life Science, General
      Science, Physical Science, General and AP Biology. It was a very interesting experience working with students that
      mostly spoke English as a second or even third language. My last overseas foray was in Panama City, Panama at The
      International School of Panama, which was a much larger school. I taught General Biology, General Physics, and IB
      Diploma Environmental Systems and Societies, once again to mostly ELL students.</p>
    <p>At this point I have experience teaching at every secondary grade level from 6-12th and at varied ability levels,
      including special education and English language learners, as well as covering just about every major science
      topic in some way or another. I have narrowed down to three main focuses when it comes to my instruction/curriculum:</p>
    <p></p>
    <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Critical thinking --> Computational Thinking</li>
      <li>Differentiated Instruction</li>
      <li>Increased usage of varied forms of emerging technology</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <p>I think more about the questions that I answer for my students nowadays, because I want them to realize that they
      live in an age unprecedented in its availability of information. I want them to understand that they don't need me
      to answer every question that they have, there are many that they should get accustomed to figuring out on their
      own. There is nothing wrong with struggling to work through situations, answers should not always be obvious but
      they should be accessible.</p>
    <p>I have a varied many interests including cooking, traveling, stock investment, reading, drama, and all things
      technology. I enjoy the ability to pass on these skills to my students through curriculum integration or extra-
      curricular activities. Above all though I am a teacher first and I believe that my strong knowledge in many
      subject areas and curriculum writing ability engenders the faith of my students in my ability to teach. I am a
      team player and freely share my skills with others, as well as keeping an open mind to the fact that I can always
      learn from others, including my students.</p>
    <p>"Life requires unrelenting effort, a willingness to try â€“ and contrary to widely held conceptions, humans are
      well fitted for the effort. In humans, the long process of evolution has produced a species of problem solvers,
      happiest when engaged in tasks that require not only physical effort but also the engagement of mind and heart. We
      are not only problem solvers but problem seekers. If a suitable problem is not at hand, we invent one. Most games
      are invented problems. We are designed for the climb, not for taking our ease, either in the valley or at the
      summit." - Caouette, A.</p>
